Autocrypt for Internet Freedom Festival 2018
============================================

This repo contains handouts, notes, and slides for the [Autocrypt
session at IFF
2018](https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/238).

To build, you probably want the following packages installed:

 * inkscape
 * python3
 * pdftk
 * fonts-linuxlibertine

Many of the icons and graphics used came from other free software
packages, including `tango-icon-theme` and `thunderbird`, etc.  They
are incorporated here by copying, not by reference.
